1 - Download and install the tor browser
    - https://www.torproject.org/download/

2 - Connect your tor browser to the tor network
    - when you launch Tor it is going to ask you to connect to the 'Tor' network. Click 'Connect' to establish a connection

3 - Navigate to TORZON
    - https://t5w6rgmpklhrkhg7dshkxukfjpm4pjbjr7j6uzx56u6xgimikmajdpid.onion/

4 - Create an account
    - this should be completely different from any account or password or pin you have ever used or created before in your entire life

5 - Save the mnemonic phrase
    - don't lose this!

6 - Go to WALLET at the top of the screen

7 - Copy your wallet address
    - this is where you store the crypto currency funds you would use to purchase from the market

8 - Download CashApp on your mobile phone if you don't already have it

9 - Back on Torzon, click on MARKET at the top of the screen

10 - Search for the item you are looking for
    - Example: "Extra Stength Tylenol"

11 - Locate a vendor with the product you want that ships to the United States and accepts Bitcoin

12 - Use CashApp to fund your Torzon wallet
    - Purchase BTC (bitcoin) within CashApp
    - Once you have BTC in your CashApp wallet that is slightly more than the price of the product you want to purchase plus shipping, you can send it from CashApp to the wallet address that you saved in step 7

_From this point onward the steps become theoretical as I have not tested the purchasing process myself_

13 - Prepare to make your purchase

14 - Copy the PGP KEY from the purchase screen before you complete your purchase and be sure to check the box at the bottom that says USE PGP encryption

15 - When you complete your purchase, the price of the item plus it's shipping cost should be deducted from your Torzon wallet and held in ESCROW until the vendor completes their half of the bargain

**NOTE:** When you complete your purchase it generates an INVOICE for the seller, but it does not appear to collect any shipping information at this time. I imagine this happens post-transaction as there is no option to add this to your 'profile' on TORZON

**RISKS AND WARNINGS:** Unfortunately, as is the case with all things of this nature there are no guarantees that the vendor you choose will be reputable / free of scams. The site itself provides a sort of ranking and rating system but we should always take these things with a grain of salt and understand the risk of losing everything in a transaction like this is always there.
